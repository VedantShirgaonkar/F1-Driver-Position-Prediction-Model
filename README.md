# F1 Driver Final Position Prediction Model

This project is designed to predict the final position of an F1 driver in a race using machine learning. The model takes into account several key factors, including grid position, driver attributes, constructor data, and race conditions, to make its predictions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information from past F1 races, with features like:

	•	Grid Position
	•	Driver Nationality and Age
	•	Constructor Name
	•	Circuit Location and Weather Conditions
	•	Lap Times and Pit Stops

## Key Features of the Model

	•	Random Forest Classifier: Chosen for its strong performance on structured data.
	•	PCA: Used to reduce the feature space for optimized performance.
	•	One-Hot Encoding: Applied to categorical variables like driver nationality and constructor name.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input race details and predict the driver’s final position.

## Future Improvements

	1.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for optimizing performance and improving confidence.
	2.	Model Ensembling: Combine models like Random Forest and XGBoost to boost accuracy and reduce variance.
	3.	Handle Class Imbalance: Use techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address imbalanced classes and enhance confidence for minority outcomes.
	4.	Feature Engineering: Add new features like performance trends and track-specific data for better predictions.
	5.	Time-Series Analysis: Incorporate time-series data to model race position evolution and predict outcomes more accurately.
